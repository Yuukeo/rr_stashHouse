Stash houses using ESX Inventory

So I have started on a stash house script, but I am quite a noob when it comes to ESX. So if you wanna try to finish it up yourself,
your welcome to download it and do whatever you have to do :D 

I will still complete it myself and update it here :D

Update 12.20.2019: 
Changed the config.lua and client.lua /removed the other locations to keep things easier.
